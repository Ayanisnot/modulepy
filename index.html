 makes pizza is known as a pizzaioloPizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world.
 Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.
 In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.
 In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand.
 Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly.
 Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.</i>
